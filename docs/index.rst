Welcome to Django on App Engine's documentation!
================================================

Welcome to Django on App Engine documentation. 

Motivation to  create this project  was fact of publication  by Google
CloudSQL backend. This library is not for production ready the same as
Google  App Engine  CloudSQL is  not  ready  for production  yet  being
currently  in  development  preview.   This  library  doesn't  support
django-nonrel. You are able still to  use BigTable models but not as a
Django backend.


Project  is  inspired  by work  of  Waldemar  Kornewald and Thomas
Wanschik,  some  ideas  where   moved  from  original  djangoappengine
project.
